PermutationTest_v1_App.mlapp is a matlab appdesigner project.
It takes courtship indexes of experimental groups (naive and trained) and control groups (naive and trained) and performs analysis below:

  calculates learning index for experimental and control groups;

  compare courtship indexes between naive and trained groups with permutaion test and ranksum test;

  compare learning indexes between experimental group and control group with permutation test;
  
The outputs are the courtship indexes boxtplot, learning indexex bar plot and an excel sheet file with all the CIs, LIs and test results.
